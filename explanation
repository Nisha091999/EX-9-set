def get_unique_elements(set1, set2, set3):

This line defines a function named get_unique_elements that takes three sets (set1, set2, and set3) as input parameters.
unique_elements = set()

This line initializes an empty set called unique_elements to store the unique elements from the input sets.
for element in set1:

This line starts a loop that iterates over each element in set1.
if element not in set2 and element not in set3:

This line checks if the current element is not present in set2 and set3.
unique_elements.add(element)

This line adds the current element to the unique_elements set if it satisfies the condition in the previous line.
The next two for loops (lines 8-10 and 12-14) perform similar operations as explained above, but for set2 and set3 respectively.

sorted_elements = sorted(unique_elements)

This line creates a new list called sorted_elements by sorting the elements in the unique_elements set in ascending order.
return sorted_elements

This line returns the sorted_elements list as the result of the function.
set1 = {11, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

This line creates a set named set1 with the values 11, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.
set2 = {25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70}

This line creates a set named set2 with the values 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70.
set3 = {3, 9, 20, 30, 40, 50, 20}

This line creates a set named set3 with the values 3, 9, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 20.
output_set = get_unique_elements(set1, set2, set3)

This line calls the get_unique_elements function with set1, set2, and set3 as arguments, and assigns the returned value to output_set.
print(output_set)

This line prints the output_set, which contains the unique elements from set1, set2, and set3 after sorting.
Overall, the code takes three input sets, finds the elements that are unique to each set (not present in the other two sets), 
combines them into a set, sorts the unique elements, and returns the sorted elements as the output. Finally, it prints the sorted output set.
